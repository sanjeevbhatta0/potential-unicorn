## 🎖️ AI-Powered Credibility Scoring

### What It Does

Calculates an **objective credibility score (0-100)** for every article based on:
1. **Cross-Coverage** (30%) - How many sources report the story
2. **Source Diversity** (20%) - Mix of mainstream/independent/international
3. **Source Reputation** (20%) - Historical accuracy of sources
4. **Fact Consistency** (15%) - Agreement on key facts
5. **AI Verification** (15%) - Claude AI fact-checking

### Credibility Badges

**🟢 Verified (90-100)**
- Multiple sources confirm the story
- Facts consistent across sources
- ✓ Highly credible - safe to trust and share

**🔵 Credible (70-89)**
- Covered by reputable sources
- Good source diversity
- ✓ Generally trustworthy

**🟡 Unverified (50-69)**
- Limited cross-verification
- Single or few sources
- ! Use caution

**🔴 Questionable (0-49)**
- Single unverified source
- High bias detected
- ⚠ Verify before sharing

### How It Works

**Step 1: Cross-Reference Detection**
- Uses OpenAI embeddings to find similar articles
- Calculates semantic similarity (cosine similarity > 0.75)
- Groups articles about the same story

**Step 2: Multi-Factor Analysis**
- Counts number of sources covering the story
- Analyzes source diversity (types and biases)
- Calculates average source reputation
- Uses Claude AI to extract and compare key facts
- AI verification for objectivity and bias detection

**Step 3: Score Calculation**
- Weighted average of all 5 factors
- Returns score (0-100) with confidence level
- Generates human-readable explanation

**Step 4: Visual Display**
- Compact badge on article cards
- Detailed breakdown on article detail pages
- Color-coded for quick recognition
